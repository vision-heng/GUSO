## 🛎️Updates
<!-- * **` Jan 13th, 2026`**: GUSO dataset and FHReg inference code are now online!! -->
* **` Jan 13th, 2026`**: GUSO dataset and FHReg inference code are coming soon!


## ✨ Highlights

* **Global Scale**: Comprising **593,335** UHR SAR-optical pairs (0.16–0.98 m resolution) spanning 319 cities across 78 countries and six continents.
* **Precision Alignment**: Achieving rigorous spatial consistency through fine-grained manual registration, meeting the demands of precision cross-modal applications.
* **Broad Generalizability**: Beyond **Multi-modal Remote Sensing Image Registration**, it serves as a robust benchmark for diverse downstream tasks: **Multi-modal Image Fusion** and **Foundation Model Pre-Training and Fine-tuning**.
* **Robust Method**: Introducing a **frequency-guided hierarchical registration method**, validated across three benchmarks: the OS-Dataset, MSAW, and GUSO datasets.
