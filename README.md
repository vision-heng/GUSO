## 🛎️Updates
<!-- * **` Jan 13th, 2026`**: GUSO dataset and FHReg inference code are now online!! -->
* **` Jan 13th, 2026`**: GUSO dataset and FHReg inference code are coming soon!


## ✨ Highlights

* **Global Scale**: Comprising *593,335* UHR SAR-optical pairs (0.16–0.98 m resolution) spanning 319 cities across 78 countries and six continents.
* **Precision Alignment**: Achieving rigorous spatial consistency through fine-grained manual registration, meeting the demands of precision cross-modal applications.
* **Broad Generalizability**: Beyond *Multi-modal Remote Sensing Image Registration*, it serves as a robust benchmark for diverse downstream tasks: *Multi-modal Image Fusion* and *Foundation Model Pre-Training and Fine-tuning*.
* **Robust Method**: Introducing a *frequency-guided hierarchical registration method*, validated across three benchmarks: the OS-Dataset, MSAW, and GUSO datasets.
